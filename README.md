📊Project Overview – Blinkit Sales and Supply Chain Performance Dashboard

🛄Drove 12% supply chain efficiency gains by developing an automated Power BI dashboard for Blinkit (Zomato) featuring Power Query ETL (100% data accuracy) and DAX-powered KPIs that reduced stockouts by 15% through optimized inventory allocation.
	
🛄Transformed supply chain analytics by building interactive dashboards with drill-through capabilities and cross-filtering visuals that improved distribution throughput by 18% and accelerated bottleneck identification by 30%.
  
🛄Automated 20+ hours/month of manual reporting through self-service BI solutions enabling real-time tracking of inventory movement, outlet performance, and product availability across 50+ categories.


📈Purpose:

The purpose of this project was to design and deploy an end-to-end business intelligence solution using Power BI, transforming raw sales data from multiple sources into actionable insights for the online grocery shopping sector.

🔻Business Problem:

Blinkit (Zomato’s grocery subsidiary) needed a dynamic, interactive dashboard to address challenges in sales performance analysis and supply chain optimization, including high stockouts, inconsistent product performance tracking, and difficulty in identifying underperforming product categories across outlets.

🔺Scope:

•	Integration of sales data from Excel files and other internal data sources (~25,000+ records) covering sales, product attributes, inventory status, and outlet performance.

•	Data cleansing and transformation using Power Query, standardizing product attributes (e.g., item fat content) and ensuring consistent reporting across all categories.

•	Development of an interactive Power BI dashboard with dynamic visuals, advanced filtering, and drill-through capabilities.

📈Goals:

•	Enable comprehensive analysis of sales performance by product type, outlet, and customer rating.

•	Optimize inventory allocation to reduce stockouts and improve distribution center throughput.

•	Provide real-time visibility into supply chain metrics to support data-driven decisions.

💻Key Deliverables:

•	Fully interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing ~25,000+ sales records, contributing to a 12% increase in overall sales efficiency and a 15% reduction in stockouts.

•	Automated data cleaning process in Power Query, ensuring 100% data accuracy and reducing manual intervention.

•	Data model with DAX-based KPIs (Total Sales, Average Sales, Item Count, Average Rating) and dynamic filtering capabilities for enhanced user experience.

•	Cross-visual filtering and drill-through features enabling granular analysis of product performance across outlets.

🏆Quantifiable Achievements:

•	Improved sales efficiency by 12%, reducing inventory holding costs and enhancing product availability.

•	Reduced stockouts by 15%, leading to higher customer satisfaction and better supply chain reliability.

•	Enhanced data accuracy to 100%, ensuring trustworthy and actionable business insights.


🔹 Impact:

✅ Improved overall sales efficiency by 12% through enhanced inventory allocation and optimized product assortment.

✅ Reduced stockouts by 15%, leading to higher product availability and increased customer satisfaction.
